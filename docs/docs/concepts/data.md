# Data

The basic container for information generated by an actor in the system.

A Data is a struct that holds the data that will be consumed and/or produced by steps in your workflow.
These objects must implement the `IData` interface, which basically means that they should be a `struct`.
## Definition

```go
type IData interface {
}
```

For a user initiating a cab ride request, this is what the initial `Data` might look like.

```go
type UserInitiationRequest struct{
  userId string
  source string
  dest string
}
```
